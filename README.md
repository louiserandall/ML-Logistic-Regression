# ML-Logistic-Regression

Read the Iris data set (Iris.csv) into a Jupyter notebook.
● There are three iris classes in the dataset and we want to create a classifier
that will predict whether an iris belongs to the ‘Iris-setosa' class or not. 
This means that we have two classes, ‘Iris-setosa' and not-‘Iris-setosa' (which
consists of 'Iris-versicolor' and 'Iris-virginica' ).

○ Identify your independent variables x.

○ Encode your dependent variable y such that ‘Iris-setosa' is encoded
as 0, and 'Iris-versicolor' and 'Iris-virginica' are both encoded as 1. (0
corresponds to the 'Iris-versicolor' class, and 1 corresponds to the
not-‘Iris-setosa' class.)

○ Split the data into a training and test set.

○ Use sklearn’s logistic regression function to fit a model and make
predictions on the test set.

○ Use sklearn to obtain a confusion matrix comparing the predictions
to the gold labels.

○ Examine the confusion matrix and predict in a comment whether
the model is likely to have higher precision, higher recall, or similar
precision and recall.

○ Write your own code to calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall,
and check whether your prediction was right
